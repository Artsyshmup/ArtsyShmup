        <p>A 2D shmup in space where in each level you progress

        will be realistic and gradually become more stylistic, simulating

        <h2>Game Play Draft</h2>
        <div class="content">
    <p>Each level contains 'platforms' which allow the player to move in discrete units towards the end of the level.
        At each platform the player must defeat a wave of enemies before the next platform becomes available for him
        to move to.  The player can move backwards to a limit of 5 platforms to prevent excessive backtracking.  The
        objective is to reach the last platform of the level and defeat the last wave of enemies.  The game is set in
        space with the character as an astronaut shooting off enemies with a laser weapon.  The mouse can be used to
        aim the laser weapon in any direction around the player, and enemies in the waves can fly in at the player
        from all directions.  The key actions are move and shoot and the mechanics are kept as simple as possible to
        allow players to focus on the artistic elements of the game.
    </p>
    <p>As said before, the game is set in space but the physics are different: the player’s character uses gravity
	 and his/her discrete movements are go forward/backwards and jump. However, gravity does not affect the enemies
	 the player must defeat.
        </p>

			<h2>Mechanics</h2>
			<div class="content">
				<p>The player, who is affected by gravity unlike the enemies, moves and jumps from platform to platform in space. Normal enemies 
				are spawned around him and move towards the player to hurt him. Shooting enemies are spawned around him and 
				shoot at him but they don't move. Phantom enemies are spawned on random platforms and don't harm the player, they 
				just block the path and make the player face other enemies while trying to kill the phantom enemy.
				</p>
				<p>Different enemies are introduced in different levels.</p>
				<p>The height the player can reach jumping from platform to platform changes from platform to platform and 
				is random, so the platforms are spawned at random positions related to the height the player can reach.</p>
				<p>The player moves and jumps using the arrow keys or the keys A, W, D. The player can pause the game pressing 
				the space bar, and resume pressing the same key again.</p>
				<p>The player will die if he falls between platforms. Enemies and player have a specific number of lives and will 
				die when they run out of them. To avoid dying, the player must shoot at the enemies until they are dead. Killing enemies will 
				reward the player with points (different amount of points depending on the type of enemy).</p>
				<p>The player starts with 3 lives and every time a new level is reached, the number of lives will increase by 1. There is a specific number 
				of enemies of the same type that can be alive at the same time. When the player kills an enemy, a new enemy of the same kind will be spawned shortly after.</p>
				<p>To aim, the user can use the mouse. To shoot, the left mouse button must be pressed. The player has unlimited number 
				of bullets.</p>
				<p>The player jumps from platform to platform moving right to recover a lost object. Once he gets it, he must go back moving left.
				When he's about to reach the final portal, a boss enemy will be spawned. The boss enemy shoots multiple bullets at the same time and the player 
				must shoot him until he's dead.</p>
				<p>Between levels there are intermediate dialogue scenes where the player has a conversation with Mr Anubis. To load the next dialogue 
				in the conversation, the NEXT button on the bottom of the screen must be pressed.</p>
				<p>There is a cheating system that can be used a set number of times in each level but it's not explained to the player.</p>
