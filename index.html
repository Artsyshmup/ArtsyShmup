<h1>Artsy Shmup</h1>
<h4>A shmup in space where you jump platforms
and blast baddies only to reveal it was all an escapist
fantasy in the mind of a scared kid</h4>
<h2>Game Concept:</h2>
<p>A 2D shmup in space where in each level you progress
by moving from platform to platform (discrete movement)
and fighting off waves of enemies with shooting controlled
by the mouse in all directions. Initially the visual aesthetic
will be realistic and gradually become more stylistic, simulating
the escapist fantasy of a child in an awkward social situation as
revealed in the final level.</p>

<h2>Platform:</h2>
<p>We have decided to use Unity to build our game for its accessiblity and the fact that it's free.</p>

    <hr>
    <h2>Game Play Draft:</h2>
    <p>Each level contains 'platforms' which allow the player to move in discrete units towards the end of the level.
        At each platform the player must defeat a wave of enemies before the next platform becomes available for him
        to move to.  The player can move backwards to a limit of 5 platforms to prevent excessive backtracking.  The
        objective is to reach the last platform of the level and defeat the last wave of enemies.  The game is set in
        space with the character as an astronaut shooting off enemies with a laser weapon.  The mouse can be used to
        aim the laser weapon in any direction around the player, and enemies in the waves can fly in at the player
        from all directions.  The key actions are move and shoot and the mechanics are kept as simple as possible to
        allow players to focus on the artistic elements of the game.
    </p>
    <p>As said before, the game is set in space but the physics are different: the player’s character uses gravity
	 and his/her discrete movements are go forward/backwards and jump. However, gravity does not affect the enemies
	 the player must defeat.</p>
