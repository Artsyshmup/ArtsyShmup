<h2>A shmup in space where you jump platforms
and blast baddies only to reveal it was all an escapist
fantasy in the mind of a scared kid</h2>

<h1>Game Concept:</h1>
<p>A 2D shmup in space where in each level you progress
by moving from platform to platform (discrete movement)
and fighting off waves of enemies with shooting controlled
by the mouse in all directions. Initially the visual aesthetic
will be realistic and gradually become more stylistic, simulating
the escapist fantasy of a child in an awkward social situation as
revealed in the final level.</p>
