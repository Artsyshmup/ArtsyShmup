	<h2>Story</h2>
        <div class="content" id="story">
		<p>
			The game begins as a sleek, faceless robot appears on screen. Behind him is the fantastic void of space
			and a swirling galaxy of stars. The robot stands atop a floating, metallic platform looking cool and
			collected. At that point, a voice cries out to him and the robot moves forward.
		</p>
		<p>
			Suddenly, the robot is surronded by alien lifeforms that look like hideous versions of Earth rats, insects,
			bats, and vultures. Blasting his way through the disgusing, oozing enemies, the robot sees a cyborg being
			attacked by the lifeforms. Saving her, the robot approaches the cyborg. Her armor torn, wires exposed,
			the cyborg promises to show the robot to her stronghold as a sign of thanks.
		</p>
		<p>
			As the robot moves ahead toward this stronghold, a ghastly new enemy that appears as a shadowy mist attacks.
			the robot's weapons are useless and only the beam cannon from the cyborg can dispel these formless
			figures. However, at the entrance to the stronghold, one of the phantoms sneaks up on the cyborg and lifts
			her up. The robot is helpless but to watch his ally be torn apart. Her arms and legs are torn off and her
			chest explodes as parts rocket in all directions. A husk of the former cyborg falls to the robot's feet
			and he drags her carcass inside.
		</p>
		<p>
			Inside the compound, the robot meets another robot who calls himself "Mr. Anubis". He wears a tuxedo on
			his body and his head appears as a giant television monitor. Mr. Anubis looks at the robot carrying the
			cyborg's body and reassures him that what is not dead can never die; that robots and cyborgs can always
			be pieced back together. It is lifeforms that are fated to decay into nothingness and that is what makes
			them dangerous, according to Mr. Anubis. He tasks our nameless protangonist to find the 8 missing pieces
			to this cyborg: her left and right arm, her left and right leg, her battery pack, her beam cannon,
			her motherboard, and her heart. The robot accepts this task and proceeds through the next level.
		</p>
		<p>
			The robot then enters the sector of space populated by the diseased rats that the robot fought earlier.
			Here they are even more numerous and more powerful. Detecting that the left arm is in this region of
			space, the robot pushes forward, despite many of his enemies shouting at him "IT ISN'T WORTH IT" before
			he shot them down. Wedged in a the crater of a desolate moon, the robot finds the cyborg's left arm
			covered in blood and viscera. The robot stores it away thinking no more.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, in trying to leave this diseased sector, even more rats discend upon him. Their heads are twisted
			and uncanny smiles are fixed upon their faces. Their shouts of "LEAVE THIS PLACE" being met with the
			robots own shouts of "I AM!" After blasting through wave after wave, the robot comes across the Rat King,
			a shrimpy fellow who shoots acid from his mouth. But before they fight, the Rat King tells the robot
			that his little game is done and that he should stop resisting; he should know better than to act so
			childish and instead leave this place. The robot refuses and the fight burns away the Rat King until all
			that's left is the cyborg's battery pack in the former enemy's stomach.
		</p>
		<p>
			The robot returns back to Mr. Anubis who congradulates him. He tells the robot that by fighting the
			Rat King, he has faced death and won. That nothing can stand against his might and that they should
			rule over this universe for all eternity. But first he will need to find the cyborg's next few pieces.
		</p>
		<p>
			Heading over the the bat sector of space, the robot faces the phantoms that loom overhead. They do
			not attack but instead whisper for you to stop burying your head. You should stop avoiding the truth. The
			robot yells at them to go away and then a swarm of bats attack. Beating the bats, the robot moves ahead and
			finds the cyborg's beam cannon. With this new weapon, the robot beats back the phantoms but as they leave, 
			they still whisper of the futility of your actions.
		</p>
		<p>
			Almost out of the sector, the Bat Septum appears, his leathery wings like cloak falls around his withered
			body. The enormous, ugly bat charges the robot but the robot eventually rips his head off. Sticking out
			of the neck stump is the cyborg's left leg. Retrieving it, the robot returns back to the stronghold.
		</p>
		<p>
			Mr. Anubis is hard at work repairing the cyborg, caressing her chassis. His hands are preoccupied deep
			inside the cyborg's motionless body, when he sees the robot has entered and seen him, Mr. Anubis drops
			the body. No comment is spoken by either party about this happening and instead, Mr. Anubis quickly
			brushes off the robot to find the next piece by going into the insect sector of space.
		</p>
		<p>
			Along the way, the robot feels himself getting dizzy, getting angry, getting strectched apart by the
			strain of space travel. His mind feels as if its going to rip like a piece of paper being pulled apart
			by two strong hands. He snaps back into focus as a wave of moths attack him.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the heart of the insect space, the robot finds the motherboard he's seeking. By holding this piece of
			circuitry, the robot sees an event from the cyborg's point of view: her death. The robot howls in pain as
			he experiences a death happen to him. (It is at this point, that the color pallette of the game will
			shift; various sprites in the game will appear "glitchy"; the audio track will become much darker at
			this point.)
		</p>
		<p>
			Escaping from the insect sector, the robot runs into the Moth Boss. The robot screams that the Boss
			can't stop him, that he will complete his task no matter what. The Boss expresses pity at the robot's
			obvious pain, offering to shield him and comfort the robot. But as the robot refuses with blasts of
			his gun, the Moth Boss does not get angry but almost embarassed for the robot and the scene he's
			making. At the end of the fight, the Moth Boss tries to act authoritative, commanding the robot
			to think of someone other than himself, but the robot rips the wings off the moth and pulls from his
			spine the right leg of the cyborg.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the stronghold, Mr. Anubis congratulates the robot for doing his job so diligently. Although he says
			he means retrieving the pieces of the cyborg, Mr. Anubis focuses much of his praise on not listening to
			the various boss monsters the robot has faced. Without even being told what they said, Mr. Anubis puts
			a great emphasis on paying no mind to particular phrases that each boss has said. The robot can
			hardly maintain conversation at this point and Mr. Anubis does all the talking before sending him back
			out for the last two pieces.
		</p>
		<p>
			The robot blacks out in the stronghold and finds himself falling into vulture space. Landing on a
			platform, the robot wants to catch his breath the vultures attack almost immediately. (In this level,
			the visual and audio glitches become much more pronounced and even intrusive on playing the game.)
			Finally, the robot finds the right arm of the cyborg and he begins to regain his voice. He cries
			out into the inky black void that he will not let anyone and anything keep him down. He is the
			strongest fighter in the universe and nothing can stop him!
		</p>
		<p>
			After this pep talk, the robot easily blasts through the next wave of vultures. (At this point, the
			visual and audio glitches stop, but the color pallette remains the same). Then the Vulture Lord
			descends upon the robot, telling him that he doesn't have to act like a strong man; that sometimes
			it's okay to cry. That you have more people you can turn to then simply the television he is currently
			subject to right now. The Vulture Lord acts friendly but he dies like all the rest. Wrapped around
			the Vulture Lord's neck is the metallic heart of the cyborg. But once the robot picks it up, it
			begins to beat again. The robot holds it in his hand, staring at it as blood starts to pump from its
			severed blood vessels. It turns red and organic in the robot's hands. (The journey back from the
			Vulture Lord to the stronghold is enemyless and the most glitchy aspect of the game.)
		</p>
		<p>
			Confronting Mr. Anubis, the robot hands him the heart of the cyborg, but instead of repairing her,
			Mr.Anubis consumes all the pieces of her and transforms into a grotesque monster that towers over the
			robot. At the end of each stage of this final boss fight, we, the audience, stare into Mr. Anubis'
			monitor that is his head and from his monitor, we see the next stage of the boss fight. As the fight
			progresses, Mr. Anubis takes on moves and appearances from each of the previous boss fights.
			Furthermore, the screen through which we watch this fight grows more cracked with each passing stage,
			until finally Mr. Anubis dies, screaming about immortality, and the screen shatters.
		</p>
		<p>
			Fade to the final level, which has no platforming or shooting. We simply see our player character
			as a young boy, perhaps seven or eight, in formal wear. He rises from a smashed computer screen and
			leaves the room. Along the way, he meets his brother, who wears the same goatee as the Rat King, who
			awkwardly tries sound proud that the boy has finally left his room, but mostly he sounds annoyed that
			it took him so long. The second person he meets is a priest with large ears and a swirling black garmet.
			The priest says a quick pious prayer with the boy. The third person he meets is the boy's father. The
			man is poor and dealing with a bug problem in his house, a moth always seems to be flying from his
			clothes every day now. The last person the boy meets is his grandfather, a man who has a long neck
			and a bent back. The grandfather says nothing, he simply hugs the boy and walks with him to their
			final destination. The boy walks across the living room, to see the open casket at his mother's funeral.
		</p>
		<p>
			Fade to black and roll credits.

    	<h2>Characters</h2>
        <div class="content" id="characters">
    	<h3>Horus, the Main Character (aka the robot, aka the boy)</h3>
    	<p>
    		The main character is a blank space exhibiting little enough personality to allow the player to fill into
    		the character's shoes; not even possesing a name. Indeed, the visual design reinforces this notion as 
    		the player character has no face and thus, any emotion will come from the player's reaction to events rather
    		than from the character himself. As this game is about willfully secluding yourself in an escapist fantasy,
    		it is far more effective to let the player's continued engagement with the game to reflect the main
    		character's seclusion than anything the character could say to the player.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		The only definitive traits the character will show is that he is susceptible to pain and mental breakdowns. 
    		Additionally, by the end of the story, the main character is revealed to be a young boy, somewhere between
    		5 and 7 years old.
    	</p>
    	<h3>Osiris, the Cyborg (aka the mother)</h3>
    	<p>
    		The cyborg reflects motherly traits as she attempts to protect and defend her son. However, after her death
    		her precence in the story haunts the game and the boy's inability to let her go is what keeps him in the
    		game.
    	</p>
    	<h3>Mr. Anubis (aka Set)</h3>
    	<p>
    		Functioning as a Lucifer figure, Mr. Anubis initially appears as helpful and friendly figure before revealing
    		himself to be the true enemy of the game. He is the personification of the boy's fear and his need for
    		escapism. Mr. Anubis tempts the boy to stay forever inside the fantasy and never face reality. This narrative
    		role is reinforced by Mr. Anubis' mechanical role as the tutorial guide and as the main source of positive
    		feedback for the player.
    	</p>
    	<h3>Harpocrates, the Rat King (aka the older brother)</h3>
    	<p>
    		The Rat King, the first boss you meet, is the older brother of the boy. At age 16, he's much older than the boy
    		and is often annoyed by his younger brother. Although he knows that he should be the more mature one and try to
    		comfort his brother, he can't help but let his embarassment and frustration show. He's trying to be strong in the
    		wake of their mother's death and dealing with his little brother's childishness is making that difficult.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		Before their mother's death, the elder brother would play pranks on the younger one in good fun, but now the
    		toe the line between "boys being boys" pranks and outright cruelty. These are reflected in the Rat King's
    		attack pattern as he will, rather than attack head-on, place traps on the platforms to create obstacles for the
    		player to dodge around.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		The visual design of this character is meant to be a mixture between a typical teenage "mall rat" and a
    		trickster god from Norse or African mythology. Most prominent will be the hood with which the Rat King will
    		hide his face. In the final level, where we see reality, the real older brother will also wear a hoodie to
    		cover his face.
    	</p>
    	
    	<h3>Thoth, the Bat Septum (aka the Priest)</h3>
    	<p>
    		The Bat Septum appears as a half-man half-bat monstrosity and is the third boss of the game.
    		He is the counterpart of the Priest in the real
    		world. The Priest's outlook on death is somewhat cold and distant as he believes that anyone worth shedding
    		a tear over is in a much better place. Thus, he regards mourning to be a largely irrational act. He tells the
    		boy to be happy that his mother is in heaven and any grief should be directed through prayer. In response to
    		the boy's escapist attitudes, the priest grows condescending and even flustered.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		The visual design for this character is to have his wings draped around his body so that they resemble the
    		priest's robes in real life. His attacks will be from afar, using projectiles and minions to attack.
    	</p>
    	
    	<h3>Isis, the Moth Boss (aka the Father)</h3>
    	<p>
    		The Moth Boss is the second boss that appears in the game and is the escapist counterpart to the boy's father
    		in real life. The father is an entomologist and the boy meets the father in real life in his study where he
    		has thousands of insects pinned up on his wall.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		The Father has left much of the parenting responsibilities to his wife, feeling awkward even around his own
    		children but still genuinely loves them. But as he views them as insects groping for nurishment and their
    		own self-interest, his best way of dealing with them is through bribery. Rather than comfort through 
    		authentic emotional connection, he offers cookies and other goodies as means of offering support to his
    		children. This has been enough for the children to love their dad, but in the wake the death of their mother,
    		it is not enough to fulfill the emotional needs of either son. Additionally, the father himself has taken
    		his wife's death hard and has neglected his own appearance.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		The Moth Boss' visual design will be of a misshapen moth-man. His wings will be large but frayed, and his
    		legs long and spindlely. His body is injured and half-molted. His large, cavernous eyes will have lingering
    		tears of blood drip occasionally from its sockets. What's more, the Moth Boss will try to bribe the robot
    		to leave his sector of space. When his offer is refused, he will teleport across the map to sneak up on
    		the player.
    	</p>
    	<h3>Ra, the Vulture Lord (aka the Grandfather)</h3>
    	<p>
    		The Vulture Lord is the fourth boss and the couneterpart to the boy's Grandfather in real life. The Grandfather
    		is saddened by his daughter's death and has spent much of the last few days in seclusion. Not eating much,
    		losing interest in any of his normal activities, and having little energy, Grandfather shows classic signs of
    		depression.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		When the robot confronts the Vulture Lord in the fantasy, the boss takes a lot of damage and dishes out slow
    		but devestating attacks. As the battle goes on, the Vulture Lord gets faster and faster. Interacting with his
    		grandson, the Grandfather slowly draws out of his depression and comes to grips with the fact that life goes
    		on and that other people need him. With the Vulture Lord's dying breath, he encourages the robot to do the
    		same.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		The Vulture Lord is visibly hunched just like Grandfather is in real life. His wings have razor sharp feathers
    		and his beak fraught with viscera.
    	</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
    	<hr>
    	<h2>The World</h2>
        <div class="content" id="the world">
    	<p>
    		The entire game talks place in space, with platforms crafted from drifting asteriods. Each sector is not
    		defined as much by any concrete location but by the enemies that populate it and its art style. The first
    		sector is the rat sector which is deliberately video game-y. That is, the music is light and heroic, and the
    		visuals mean to highlight the run-and-gun action of the game. Thus, the rat sector is colorful and exciting.
    		The second section is the insect sector, which might be described as "light horror". The visuals should be
    		a bit darker, with the grotesqueness of the enemies being more of a focus and with a more unhinged soundtrack.
    		Yet, this should not yet detract from the same run-and-gun action of the first sector.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		The third section should be a more firm step into the realm of psychological horror. The visuals should be
    		glitchy and the bat imagery should be both gothic and unnerving. The color palette should be a mix of dark
    		tones and offputting color combinations. There should be a dileberate feeling of "wrong-ness" to the entire
    		level. The fourth and final section should be outright Lovecraftian and should genuinely make the player
    		second-guess their sanity. Visuals should be glitchy not just in overt ways but in subtitles that make it
    		impossible for the player to completely emmerse him or herself in the game. The soundtrack should send chills
    		down a person's spine.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		The final part of the game takes place in reality, which should be quite and have a muted color palette. The
    		focus at this point should entirely be on the story and neither the visuals nor the audio should draw too
    		much attention to itself. There should be a slight "grayness" to the entire scene which should befit a funeral.
    		If there is one word to describe this part of the game, it is "solemn".
    	</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
    	<h2>The Levels</h2>
        <div class="content" id="the levels">
    	<h3>First Level</h3>
    	<p>
    		This level introduces us to the story and the gameplay mechanics, functioning as the tutorial of the game.
    		First, the traversal mechanics will be introduced so the player can move. Then the shooting mechancis will
    		be introduced on passive enemies so the player can test out their skills in a safe zone. Next, the common
    		charge enemies will attack and the player will learn about how enemy waves function. Then the cyborg will
    		cry out and the game will begin proper. Just common charge enemies will appear in this level.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		After the player meets and rescues the cyborg, phantoms will appear but the cyborg will dispel them so the
    		player needs only to traverse their way to the stronghold.
    	</p>
    	
    	<h3>Second Level</h3>
    	<p>
    		After the death of the cyborg, the robot will be sent out to retrieve the first two pieces in the rat sector.
    		This begins with the
    		player moving left to right defeating waves of enemies. These enemies will include both the common charge enemy
    		and the shooter enemy. Once the first cyborg part is collected, the player will move right to left to escape
    		the rat sector. This first collected piece of the cyborg allows an arrow to appear at the edge of the
    		player's camera view to alert them when a new enemy has spawned, giving the player more information and 
    		allowing them to handle larger waves of enemies.
    		The boss at the end of the level is the Rat King, who will jump from platform to platform
    		setting traps that the player will need to avoid as the jump from platform to platform in order to continue
    		firing on the Rat King. After defeating the Rat King, the player collects a second piece of the cyborg, which
    		does not alter the player's arsenal or mechanics.
    	</p>
    	<h3>Third Level</h3>
    	<p>
    		This level takes place in the insect sector and much of the first half of this level playes like the last level,
    		except the enemies react quicker and have more health. However, approaching the halfway point of the level, the
    		phantom enemy type is reintroduced, which at first just floats and spouts comments and retorts to the robot.
    		Then the player finds the third piece of the cyborg (the beam canon), which allows the player to shoot at the
    		phantoms. The phantoms also begin to actively attack, but with the beam cannon, the player has a way to fight
    		the phantoms. Old enemy types, the charger and the shooter, are reintigrated back into combat to evolve the
    		the combat encounters.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		The level ends with the Moth Boss attacking. The Moth Boss is basically a really large shooter enemy that hangs
    		back and shoots projectiles at the player. However, in addition to having much more health than the shooter
    		enemy types, the Moth Boss can also turn invulnerable while common enemies are on the screen, forcing the player
    		to deal with the small fry before they can attack the boss, and he can teleport at certain times to different
    		points around the player, causing them to refocus their efforts when attacking the boss. After this boss,
    		another piece of the cyborg is given but it does not mechanically affect the player.
    	</p>
    	<h3>Fourth Level</h3>
    	<p>
    		This level takes place in the bat sector. This level introduces a new enemy type from the beginning called the
    		boomerang enemy. This enemy does not fly off screen like the common charge enemy but instead keeps charging
    		until either it or the player is dead. The boomerang enemy also has a lot of health. Other than that,
    		combat and movement mechanics don't change as the player moves left to right to get to the fifth piece of the
    		cyborg. This piece is the motherboard and after collecting it, the player will experience numerous video
    		and audio glitches. Although these glitches can and should distract the player making it more difficult to
    		focus solely on trying to play a game, there is only one real mechanical glitch: fake enemies. These enemies
    		will be characterized not just by visual glitches unique to fake enemies (upside down or not animated or 
    		wrong color, etc.) but they will neither take damage nor dole damage. Thus, these enemies will charge or shoot
    		at the player but will pass right through the player without harm. Similarly, though the player will shoot
    		at them, they will not die.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		The level ends with the boss known as the Bat Septum. This boss will use darkness to hide himself at certain points
    		so the player will only be able to see the projectiles fired from his moth. Because the Bat Septum will be moving
    		while he fires, this will make it challenging for the player to predict wear the Bat Septum is at any given moment,
    		making it more difficult to hit him. After defeating the Bat Septum, the player will get the mechanically inert
    		sixth cyborg part.
    	</p>
    	<h3>Fifth Level</h3>
    	<p>
    		This level takes place in the bird sector. Mechanically, this level is very similar to the last level, except
    		the visual and audio glitches are much more pronounced and entire waves of enemies will consist almost 
    		entirely of fake enemies. After collecting seventh cyborg part, the robot narratively tries to recollect
    		his sanity and all glitches halt at this point. The second of this level has no glitches nor fake enemies.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		The level goes into a fake ending with the Vulture Lord attacking.
    		This boss dishes out a lot of slow but devasting attacks
    		and has a huge amount of health. The real difficulty comes from all the minions that show up to attack the
    		player as well. Chargers, shooters, phantoms, and boomerang enemies swarm the player. Once the Vulture Lord is
    		defeated, all the common enemy types will disappear. The eighth and final cyborg piece collected is the heart, 
    		and once its collected, a cutscene should play that should make the player think their computer is actually,
    		literally bugging out.

    		The true end boss of this level is Mr. Anubis. Mr. Anubis switches between each of the attack styles of all the
    		previous bosses along with charge attacks that are directed toward the camera. If the robot does not attack
    		Anubis while he's charging, a projectile will fire towards the screen that will trigger a visual glitch that
    		will make it more difficult to see what's going on for the next 10 seconds or so. Once Mr. Anubis is defeated,
    		the screen will crack and shatter, lifting the veil and allowing the player to see reality.

    	<h3>Sixth and Final Level</h3>
    	<p>
    		The last level has no shooting or jumping mechanics, and even the traversal mechanics change from discrete to
    		continuous movement. Instead, clicking the mouse will activate dialouge options for various interactable
    		characters. This level makes no attempt to be challenging but to instead forward the narrative to its 
    		conclusion.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		The level begins with the player character, the boy, putting down his computer (which has a cracked computer
    		screen). From there, he runs into his older brother, father, priest, and grandfather. After talking to all
    		available characters, the level ends with the boy walking to the open casket wake and crying
    		in front of his mother's corpse.
