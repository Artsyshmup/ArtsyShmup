	<h2>Story</h2>
		<p>
			The game begins as a sleek, faceless robot appears on screen. Behind him is the fantastic void of space
			and a swirling galaxy of stars. The robot stands atop a floating, metallic platform looking cool and
			collected. At that point, a voice cries out to him and the robot moves forward.
		</p>
		<p>
			Suddenly, the robot is surronded by alien lifeforms that look like hideous versions of Earth rats, insects,
			bats, and vultures. Blasting his way through the disgusing, oozing enemies, the robot sees a cyborg being
			attacked by the lifeforms. Saving her, the robot approaches the cyborg. Her armor torn, wires exposed,
			the cyborg promises to show the robot to her stronghold as a sign of thanks.
		</p>
		<p>
			As the robot moves ahead toward this stronghold, a ghastly new enemy that appears as a shadowy mist attacks.
			the robot's weapons are useless and only the beam cannon from the cyborg can dispel these formless
			figures. However, at the entrance to the stronghold, one of the phantoms sneaks up on the cyborg and lifts
			her up. The robot is helpless but to watch his ally be torn apart. Her arms and legs are torn off and her
			chest explodes as parts rocket in all directions. A husk of the former cyborg falls to the robot's feet
			and he drags her carcass inside.
		</p>
		<p>
			Inside the compound, the robot meets another robot who calls himself "Mr. Anubis". He wears a tuxedo on
			his body and his head appears as a giant television monitor. Mr. Anubis looks at the robot carrying the
			cyborg's body and reassures him that what is not dead can never die; that robots and cyborgs can always
			be pieced back together. It is lifeforms that are fated to decay into nothingness and that is what makes
			them dangerous, according to Mr. Anubis. He tasks our nameless protangonist to find the 8 missing pieces
			to this cyborg: her left and right arm, her left and right leg, her battery pack, her beam cannon,
			her motherboard, and her heart. The robot accepts this task and proceeds through the next level.
		</p>
		<p>
			The robot then enters the sector of space populated by the diseased rats that the robot fought earlier.
			Here they are even more numerous and more powerful. Detecting that the left arm is in this region of
			space, the robot pushes forward, despite many of his enemies shouting at him "IT ISN'T WORTH IT" before
			he shot them down. Wedged in a the crater of a desolate moon, the robot finds the cyborg's left arm
			covered in blood and viscera. The robot stores it away thinking no more.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, in trying to leave this diseased sector, even more rats discend upon him. Their heads are twisted
			and uncanny smiles are fixed upon their faces. Their shouts of "LEAVE THIS PLACE" being met with the
			robots own shouts of "I AM!" After blasting through wave after wave, the robot comes across the Rat King,
			a shrimpy fellow who shoots acid from his mouth. But before they fight, the Rat King tells the robot
			that his little game is done and that he should stop resisting; he should know better than to act so
			childish and instead leave this place. The robot refuses and the fight burns away the Rat King until all
			that's left is the cyborg's battery pack in the former enemy's stomach.
		</p>
		<p>
			The robot returns back to Mr. Anubis who congradulates him. He tells the robot that by fighting the
			Rat King, he has faced death and won. That nothing can stand against his might and that they should
			rule over this universe for all eternity. But first he will need to find the cyborg's next few pieces.
		</p>
		<p>
			Heading over the the bat sector of space, the robot faces the phantoms that loom overhead. They do
			not attack but instead whisper for you to stop burying your head. You should stop avoiding the truth. The
			robot yells at them to go away and then a swarm of bats attack. Beating the bats, the robot moves ahead and
			finds the cyborg's beam cannon. With this new weapon, the robot beats back the phantoms but as they leave, 
			they still whisper of the futility of your actions.
		</p>
		<p>
			Almost out of the sector, the Bat Septor appears, his leathery wings like cloak falls around his withered
			body. The enormous, ugly bat charges the robot but the robot eventually rips his head off. Sticking out
			of the neck stump is the cyborg's left leg. Retrieving it, the robot returns back to the stronghold.
		</p>
		<p>
			Mr. Anubis is hard at work repairing the cyborg, caressing her chassis. His hands are preoccupied deep
			inside the cyborg's motionless body, when he sees the robot has entered and seen him, Mr. Anubis drops
			the body.
