	<h2>Story</h2>
		<p>
			The game begins as a sleek, faceless robot appears on screen. Behind him is the fantastic void of space
			and a swirling galaxy of stars. The robot stands atop a floating, metallic platform looking cool and
			collected. At that point, a voice cries out to him and the robot moves forward.
		</p>
		<p>
			Suddenly, the robot is surronded by alien lifeforms that look like hideous versions of Earth rats, insects,
			bats, and vultures. Blasting his way through the disgusing, oozing enemies, the robot sees a cyborg being
			attacked by the lifeforms. Saving her, the robot approaches the cyborg. Her armor torn, wires exposed,
			the cyborg promises to show the robot to her stronghold as a sign of thanks.
		</p>
		<p>
			As the robot moves ahead toward this stronghold, a ghastly new enemy that appears as a shadowy mist attacks.
			the robot's weapons are useless and only the beam cannon from the cyborg can dispel these formless
			figures. However, at the entrance to the stronghold, one of the phantoms sneaks up on the cyborg and lifts
			her up. The robot is helpless but to watch his ally be torn apart. Her arms and legs are torn off and her
			chest explodes as parts rocket in all directions. A husk of the former cyborg falls to the robot's feet
			and he drags her carcass inside.
		</p>
		<p>
			Inside the compound, the robot meets another robot who calls himself "Mr. Anubis". He wears a tuxedo on
			his body and his head appears as a giant television monitor. Mr. Anubis looks at the robot carrying the
			cyborg's body and reassures him that what is not dead can never die; that robots and cyborgs can always
			be pieced back together. It is lifeforms that are fated to decay into nothingness and that is what makes
			them dangerous, according to Mr. Anubis. He tasks our nameless protangonist to find the 8 missing pieces
			to this cyborg: her left and right arm, her left and right leg, her battery pack, her beam cannon,
			her motherboard, and her heart. The robot accepts this task and proceeds through the next level.
		</p>
		<p>
			The robot then enters the sector of space populated by the diseased rats that the robot fought earlier.
			Here they are even more numerous and more powerful. Detecting that the left arm is in this region of
			space, the robot pushes forward, despite many of his enemies shouting at him "IT ISN'T WORTH IT" before
			he shot them down. Wedged in a the crater of a desolate moon, the robot finds the cyborg's left arm
			covered in blood and viscera. The robot stores it away thinking no more.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, in trying to leave this diseased sector, even more rats discend upon him. Their heads are twisted
			and uncanny smiles are fixed upon their faces. Their shouts of "LEAVE THIS PLACE" being met with the
			robots own shouts of "I AM!" After blasting through wave after wave, the robot comes across the Rat King,
			a shrimpy fellow who shoots acid from his mouth. But before they fight, the Rat King tells the robot
			that his little game is done and that he should stop resisting; he should know better than to act so
			childish and instead leave this place. The robot refuses and the fight burns away the Rat King until all
			that's left is the cyborg's battery pack in the former enemy's stomach.
		</p>
		<p>
			The robot returns back to Mr. Anubis who congradulates him. He tells the robot that by fighting the
			Rat King, he has faced death and won. That nothing can stand against his might and that they should
			rule over this universe for all eternity. But first he will need to find the cyborg's next few pieces.
		</p>
		<p>
			Heading over the the bat sector of space, the robot faces the phantoms that loom overhead. They do
			not attack but instead whisper for you to stop burying your head. You should stop avoiding the truth. The
			robot yells at them to go away and then a swarm of bats attack. Beating the bats, the robot moves ahead and
			finds the cyborg's beam cannon. With this new weapon, the robot beats back the phantoms but as they leave, 
			they still whisper of the futility of your actions.
		</p>
		<p>
			Almost out of the sector, the Bat Septor appears, his leathery wings like cloak falls around his withered
			body. The enormous, ugly bat charges the robot but the robot eventually rips his head off. Sticking out
			of the neck stump is the cyborg's left leg. Retrieving it, the robot returns back to the stronghold.
		</p>
		<p>
			Mr. Anubis is hard at work repairing the cyborg, caressing her chassis. His hands are preoccupied deep
			inside the cyborg's motionless body, when he sees the robot has entered and seen him, Mr. Anubis drops
			the body. No comment is spoken by either party about this happening and instead, Mr. Anubis quickly
			brushes off the robot to find the next piece by going into the insect sector of space.
		</p>
		<p>
			Along the way, the robot feels himself getting dizzy, getting angry, getting strectched apart by the
			strain of space travel. His mind feels as if its going to rip like a piece of paper being pulled apart
			by two strong hands. He snaps back into focus as a wave of moths attack him.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the heart of the insect space, the robot finds the motherboard he's seeking. By holding this piece of
			circuitry, the robot sees an event from the cyborg's point of view: her death. The robot howls in pain as
			he experiences a death happen to him. (It is at this point, that the color pallette of the game will
			shift; various sprites in the game will appear "glitchy"; the audio track will become much darker at
			this point.)
		</p>
		<p>
			Escaping from the insect sector, the robot runs into the Moth Boss. The robot screams that the Boss
			can't stop him, that he will complete his task no matter what. The Boss expresses pity at the robot's
			obvious pain, offering to shield him and comfort the robot. But as the robot refuses with blasts of
			his gun, the Moth Boss does not get angry but almost embarassed for the robot and the scene he's
			making. At the end of the fight, the Moth Boss tries to act authoritative, commanding the robot
			to think of someone other than himself, but the robot rips the wings off the moth and pulls from his
			spine the right leg of the cyborg.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the stronghold, Mr. Anubis congratulates the robot for doing his job so diligently. Although he says
			he means retrieving the pieces of the cyborg, Mr. Anubis focuses much of his praise on not listening to
			the various boss monsters the robot has faced. Without even being told what they said, Mr. Anubis puts
			a great emphasis on paying no mind to particular phrases that each boss has said. The robot can
			hardly maintain conversation at this point and Mr. Anubis does all the talking before sending him back
			out for the last two pieces.
		</p>
		<p>
			The robot blacks out in the stronghold and finds himself falling into vulture space. Landing on a
			platform, the robot wants to catch his breath the vultures attack almost immediately. (In this level,
			the visual and audio glitches become much more pronounced and even intrusive on playing the game.)
			Finally, the robot finds the right arm of the cyborg and he begins to regain his voice. He cries
			out into the inky black void that he will not let anyone and anything keep him down. He is the
			strongest fighter in the universe and nothing can stop him!
		</p>
		<p>
			After this prep talk, the robot easily blasts through the next wave of vultures. (At this point, the
			visual and audio glitches stop, but the color pallette remains the same). Then the Vulture Lord
			descends upon the robot, telling him that he doesn't have to act like a strong man; that sometimes
			it's okay to cry. That you have more people you can turn to then simply the television he is currently
			subject to right now. The Vulture Lord acts friendly but he dies like all the rest. Wrapped around
			the Vulture Lord's neck is the metallic heart of the cyborg. But once the robot picks it up, it
			begins to beat again. The robot holds it in his hand, staring at it as blood starts to pump from its
			severed blood vessels. It turns red and organic in the robot's hands. (The journey back from the
			Vulture Lord to the stronghold is enemyless and the most glitchy aspect of the game.)
		</p>
		<p>
			Confronting Mr. Anubis, the robot hands him the heart of the cyborg, but instead of repairing her,
			Mr.Anubis consumes all the pieces of her and transforms into a grotesque monster that towers over the
			robot. At the end of each stage of this final boss fight, we, the audience, stare into Mr. Anubis'
			monitor that is his head and from his monitor, we see the next stage of the boss fight. As the fight
			progresses, Mr. Anubis takes on moves and appearances from each of the previous boss fights.
			Furthermore, the screen through which we watch this fight grows more cracked with each passing stage,
			until finally Mr. Anubis dies, screaming about immortality, and the screen shatters.
		</p>
		<p>
			Fade to the final level, which has no platforming or shooting. We simply see our player character
			as a young boy, perhaps seven or eight, in formal wear. He rises from a smashed computer screen and
			leaves the room. Along the way, he meets his brother, who wears the same goatee as the Rat King, who
			awkwardly tries sound proud that the boy has finally left his room, but mostly he sounds annoyed that
			it took him so long. The second person he meets is a priest with large ears and a swirling black garmet.
			The priest says a quick pious prayer with the boy. The third person he meets is the boy's father. The
			man is poor and dealing with a bug problem in his house, a moth always seems to be flying from his
			clothes every day now. The last person the boy meets is his grandfather, a man who has a long neck
			and a bent back. The grandfather says nothing, he simply hugs the boy and walks with him to their
			final destination. The boy walks across the living room, to see the open casket at his mother's funeral.
		</p>
		<p>
			Fade to black and roll credits.

    	<h2>Characters</h2>
    	<h3>Main Character (aka the robot aka the boy)</h3>
    	<p>
    		The main character is a blank space exhibiting little enough personality to allow the player to fill into
    		the character's shoes; not even possesing a name. Indeed, the visual design reinforces this notion as 
    		the player character has no face and thus, any emotion will come from the player's reaction to events rather
    		than from the character himself. As this game is about willfully secluding yourself in an escapist fantasy,
    		it is far more effective to let the player's continued engagement with the game to reflect the main
    		character's seclusion than anything the character could say to the player.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		The only definitive traits the character will show is that he is susceptible to pain and mental breakdowns. 
    		Additionally, by the end of the story, the main character is revealed to be a young boy, somewhere between
    		5 and 7 years old.
    	</p>
    	<h3>The Cyborg (aka the mother)</h3>
    	<p>
    		The cyborg reflects motherly traits as she attempts to protect and defend her son. However, after her death
    		her precence in the story haunts the game and the boy's inability to let her go is what keeps him in the
    		game.
    	</p>
    	<h3>Mr. Anubis</h3>
    	<p>
    		Functioning as a Lucifer figure, Mr. Anubis initially appears as helpful and friendly figure before revealing
    		himself to be the true enemy of the game. He is the personification of the boy's fear and his need for
    		escapism. Mr. Anubis tempts the boy to stay forever inside the fantasy and never face reality. This narrative
    		role is reinforced by Mr. Anubis' mechanical role as the tutorial guide and as the main source of positive
    		feedback for the player.
    	</p>
    	<h3>Rat King (aka the older brother)</h3>
    	<p>
    		The Rat King, the first boss you meet, is the older brother of the boy. At age 16, he's much older than the boy
    		and is often annoyed by his younger brother. Although he knows that he should be the more mature one and try to
    		comfort his brother, he can't help but let his embarassment and frustration show. He's trying to be strong in the
    		wake of their mother's death and dealing with his little brother's childishness is making that difficult.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		Before their mother's death, the elder brother would play pranks on the younger one in good fun, but now the
    		toe the line between "boys being boys" pranks and outright cruelty. These are reflected in the Rat King's
    		attack pattern as he will, rather than attack head-on, place traps on the platforms to create obstacles for the
    		player to dodge around.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		The visual design of this character is meant to be a mixture between a typical teenage "mall rat" and a
    		trickster god from Norse or African mythology. Most prominent will be the hood with which the Rat King will
    		hide his face. In the final level, where we see reality, the real older brother will also wear a hoodie to
    		cover his face.
