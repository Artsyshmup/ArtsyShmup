player: I have returned Mr. Anubis.
boss: Excellent. I am keeping her in my tomb.
player: When can I see her?
boss: When you have traveled to the furthest reaches of the stars.
player: And then?
boss: And then you will wipe out everything with a heartbeat.
player: It does not feel the same as before.
boss: Do not worry. Soon, you will be numb and feelings will not matter to you anymore.
player: I am a robot. Why do I have feelings at all?
boss: Because you are pretending to be organic. That is why you must purge all organics until only metal remains.
player: ....I will be right back.
