boss: Blame me if you will, but if you want to see her again, I need more time and more death.

boss: Let me ask you a question:
player: Only if I don't have to answer.
boss: Why did you let me in the first place?

player: ...........
boss: So why do you keep doing what I ask?
player: ....because....it's easier this way.....
boss: Then keep killing.
