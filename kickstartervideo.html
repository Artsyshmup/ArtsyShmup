      <h1>Kickstarter Video</h1>
      <p>
		    The video is to be no more than 2 minutes long.
		    It is to present the rationale behind the game and show
		    off game play.
		    It should talk about the vision of the game.
		    The intention of the video is to interest people enough that they
		    would help you build it
		    (hence the "kickstarter" in the title). Final design documentation is due at the final exam.
