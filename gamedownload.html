		    We are going to prepare the game for you to play.
		    You will not have to compile it.
		    If there are prerequisites
		    required, be sure that we will let you know about them in advance.
		    We will give complete installation requirements and instructions.
		    Of course, providing a simple executable is our primary goal.

			<h3>ArtsyShmup version 0 (03/16/2015)</h3>
			<p>This first version contains the state of the game as of 03/16/2015. In this first version, the player can move at a constant speed and jump from
			one platform to the next one. Players (red square) can shoot enemies (green squares). When an enemy dies (after 3 shots), the player earns 10 points.
			The player has 3 lives and can be harmed if the enemies get close enough. This first level will spawn new platforms infinitely.</p>
			<p>ArtsyShmup v0 can be accessed <a href="http://cs.unc.edu/~raulestr/gamedev/ArtsyShmup/ArtsyShmup_v0/" target="_blank">HERE</a></p>

			<h3>ArtsyShmup version 1 (03/23/2015)</h3>
			<p><b>Improvements over the previous version</b>: In this version, acceleration was added to the movement of the player. The player will start moving at a 
			normal speed and will reach a maximum speed. Acceleration uses the formula: acceleration = mass of object * speed</p>
			<p>The camera will also move a little as the player moves the mouse around the screen. This can help focus on a zone a little further away at the top, 
			top-right, right, bottom-right, bottom, bottom-left, left or top-left.</p>
			<p>The first level is now finite: After a specified number (right now is 20) of platforms, the object that must be recovered by the player will be instantiated
			 floating on top of the last platform. Then, platforms will be spawned backwards so that the player can go back to the beginning. This way we have the two
			  parts of the level specified in the design document. When the player catches the object, the game will be paused for 2.5 seconds and will show a message to the
			   player informing him/her that he/she must go back to the beginning with the new object.</p>
			<p>The game will check if the player finishes with the object or not: if the player goes back without the object, the player will lose. If they go back with 
			the object, the player will have passed that level.</p>
			<p>When the player loses, the game over message will say "Press 'R' to restart", so the player can just press R and restart instead of refreshing or restarting 
			the application.</p>
