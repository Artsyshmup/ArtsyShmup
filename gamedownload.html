		<p>
		    We are going to prepare the game for you to play.
		    You will not have to compile it.
		    If there are prerequisites
		    required, be sure that we will let you know about them in advance.
		    We will give complete installation requirements and instructions.
		    Of course, providing a simple executable is our primary goal.
