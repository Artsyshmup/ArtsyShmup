		    We are going to prepare the game for you to play.
		    You will not have to compile it.
		    If there are prerequisites
		    required, be sure that we will let you know about them in advance.
		    We will give complete installation requirements and instructions.
		    Of course, providing a simple executable is our primary goal.

			<h3>ArtsyShmup version 0 (03/16/2015)</h3>
			<p>This first version contains the state of the game as of 03/16/2015. In this first version, the player can move at a constant speed and jump from
			one platform to the next one. Players (red square) can shoot enemies (green squares). When an enemy dies (after 3 shots), the player earns 10 points.
			The player has 3 lives and can be harmed if the enemies get close enough. This first level will spawn new platforms infinitely.</p>
			<p>ArtsyShmup v0 can be accessed <a href="http://cs.unc.edu/~raulestr/gamedev/ArtsyShmup/ArtsyShmup_v0/" target="_blank">HERE</a></p>

			<h3>ArtsyShmup version 1 (03/23/2015)</h3>
			<p><b>Improvements over the previous version</b>: In this version, acceleration was added to the movement of the player. The player will start moving at a 
			normal speed and will reach a maximum speed. Acceleration uses the formula: acceleration = mass of object * speed</p>
			<p>The camera will also move a little as the player moves the mouse around the screen. This can help focus on a zone a little further away at the top, 
			top-right, right, bottom-right, bottom, bottom-left, left or top-left.</p>
			<p>The first level is now finite: After a specified number (right now is 20) of platforms, the object that must be recovered by the player will be instantiated
			 floating on top of the last platform. Then, platforms will be spawned backwards so that the player can go back to the beginning. This way we have the two
			  parts of the level specified in the design document. When the player catches the object, the game will be paused for 2.5 seconds and will show a message to the
			   player informing him/her that he/she must go back to the beginning with the new object.</p>
			<p>The game will check if the player finishes with the object or not: if the player goes back without the object, the player will lose. If they go back with 
			the object, the player will have passed that level.</p>
			<p>When the player loses, the game over message will say "Press 'R' to restart", so the player can just press R and restart instead of refreshing or restarting 
			the application.</p>

			<h3>ArtsyShmup version 2 (03/31/2015)</h3>
			<p><b>Improvements over the previous version</b>: In this version, players will know when they've reached the end of a level because there's a portal marking 
			the end. Moreover, when the portal becomes visible the camera will lose its moving capability along the x axis. It will only move accordingly to the player's
			movements along the y axis. When players go to the portal, the level ends.</p>
			<p>Multi-level game: Now there are multiple levels, not just that initial level. When the player finishes a level, the next level is loaded. The number of platforms 
			or mechanics in different levels is still the same, but the game has knowledge of different levels. Moreover, players keep their points and lives when the go into 
			a new level.</p>
			<p>If players lose, they will go back to the beginning of the last level they reached. Their lives and points will be reset.</p>
			<p>The game contains 6 levels. After the player wins the 6th level, the game ends.</p>
			<p>New enemy: After players win the first level, a new shooting enemy is presented (purple square). There will only be two instances of this new enemy at all times. 
			The game will spawn this enemy every 4 seconds. This enemy is worth 20 points and has 2 lives. After a fixed amount of seconds, the enemy will shoot the player. 
			The enemy will keep shooting the player until the player dies or the enemy is destroyed. The enemy is spawned closer to the player than the green enemies.</p>
			<p>Pause option: The player can pause the game by pressing the space bar. The game will resume when the space bar is pressed again.</p>
			<p>Platforms and jumps: From platform to platform the amount of height the player can jump will change and take random values. The player can go back, taking 
			previous values for the jumps. The platforming is supposed to be more challenging this way.</p>
