		    We are going to prepare the game for you to play.
		    You will not have to compile it.
		    If there are prerequisites
		    required, be sure that we will let you know about them in advance.
		    We will give complete installation requirements and instructions.
		    Of course, providing a simple executable is our primary goal.

			<h3>ArtsyShmup version 0 (03/16/2015)</h3>
			<p>This first version contains the state of the game as of 03/16/2015. In this first version, the player can move at a constant speed and jump from
			one platform to the next one. Players (red square) can shoot enemies (green squares). When an enemy dies (after 3 shots), the player earns 10 points.
			The player has 3 lives and can be harmed if the enemies get close enough. This first level will spawn new platforms infinitely.</p>

			<h3>ArtsyShmup version 1 (03/23/2015)</h3>
			<p><b>Improvements over the previous version</b>: In this version, acceleration was added to the movement of the player. The player will start moving at a 
			normal speed and will reach a maximum speed. Acceleration uses the formula: acceleration = mass of object * speed</p>
			<p>The camera will also move a little as the player moves the mouse around the screen. This can help focus on a zone a little further away at the top, 
			top-right, right, bottom-right, bottom, bottom-left, left or top-left.</p>
			<p>The first level is now finite: After a specified number (right now is 20) of platforms, the object that must be recovered by the player will be instantiated
			 floating on top of the last platform. Then, platforms will be spawned backwards so that the player can go back to the beginning. This way we have the two
			  parts of the level specified in the design document. When the player catches the object, the game will be paused for 2.5 seconds and will show a message to the
			   player informing him/her that he/she must go back to the beginning with the new object.</p>
			<p>The game will check if the player finishes with the object or not: if the player goes back without the object, the player will lose. If they go back with 
			the object, the player will have passed that level.</p>
			<p>When the player loses, the game over message will say "Press 'R' to restart", so the player can just press R and restart instead of refreshing or restarting 
			the application.</p>

			<h3>ArtsyShmup version 2 (03/31/2015)</h3>
			<p><b>Improvements over the previous version</b>: In this version, players will know when they've reached the end of a level because there's a portal marking 
			the end. Moreover, when the portal becomes visible the camera will lose its moving capability along the x axis. It will only move accordingly to the player's
			movements along the y axis. When players go to the portal, the level ends.</p>
			<p>Multi-level game: Now there are multiple levels, not just that initial level. When the player finishes a level, the next level is loaded. The number of platforms 
			or mechanics in different levels are still the same, but the game has knowledge of different levels. Moreover, players keep their points and lives when the go into 
			a new level.</p>
			<p>If players lose, they will go back to the beginning of the last level they reached. Their lives and points will be reset.</p>
			<p>The game contains 6 levels. After the player wins the 6th level, the game ends.</p>
			<p>New enemy: After players win the first level, a new shooting enemy is presented (purple square). There will only be two instances of this new enemy at all times. 
			The game will spawn this enemy every 4 seconds. This enemy is worth 20 points and has 2 lives. After a fixed amount of seconds, the enemy will shoot the player. 
			The enemy will keep shooting the player until the player dies or the enemy is destroyed. The enemy is spawned closer to the player than the green enemies.</p>
			<p>Pause option: The player can pause the game by pressing the space bar. The game will resume when the space bar is pressed again.</p>
			<p>Platforms and jumps: From platform to platform the amount of height the player can jump will change and take random values. The player can go back, taking 
			previous values for the jumps. The platforming is supposed to be more challenging this way.</p>

			<h3>ArtsyShmup version 3 (04/07/2015)</h3>
			<p><b>Improvements over the previous version</b>: In the previous version the levels were too long, so now they are shorter. 
			Each level now contains 12 platforms in each direction.</p>
			<p>Previously, the camera used to move along with the player and also a little more depending on the mouse position. This made the game too shaky, so now there is 
			a bigger offset surrounding the main character. If the player wants to move the camera a little bit further with the mouse, he/she will have to move the mouse further 
			away from the player.</p>
			<p>Shooting enemies used to stay alive even if they were off-screen, so they would just keep shooting at the player. Now when shooting enemies go off-screen, they are 
			automatically destroyed.</p>
			<p>Because of the acceleration, the player could go through the first level without shooting any normal (green) enemies. To avoid this situation, there will be up to 6 
			normal enemies at any time (there's a spawning delay, so they won't appear all at the same time). Moreover, normal enemies are now faster and they are instantiated 
			closer to the player, so players will always have enemies following them closely.</p>
			<p>New keys to move around: Added functionality to the keys A, D and W so the gaming experience is more comfortable. Key 'A' will make the player go backwards. Key 'D' will make the player move forward. Key 'W' will make the player jump.</p>
			<p>Dialog: Added intermediate scene where dialog will take place between the player and a boss. Between each level and the next one, this scene will be loaded and 
			a different dialog will be displayed. This is a way to integrate the story. We still don't have the concrete dialog, so the dialog we have so far is just a sample text.
			After the dialog ends, the next level is automatically loaded.</p>
			<p>Sound: Added laser sound effects that will be played when the player shoots. Added a different sound effect when the shooting enemies shoot at the player. 
			Another sound effect will be played when the player dies.</p>
			<p>Added menu screen: When the game is loaded, a scene with infinite scrolling background and background music will be displayed with the title of the game and a text 
			message prompting the user to press the space key to start playing the game.</p>

			<h3>ArtsyShmup version 4 (04/13/2015)</h3>
			<p><b>Improvements over the previous version</b>: The initial number of lives the player has increases every time players go to the next level. (3 lives in level 1, 4 lives 
			in level 2, and so on). When the player goes from one level to the next one he/she will keep his/her lives and score, but the lives will be reset if players die, and the initial 
			number is what changes.</p>
			<p>The score is 'committed' when the players go to the next level. Before if the players lose then the score is reset to 0. Now, when the players go to the next level their score 
			will be set as the initial score, so if they lose in a given level they will reset their score to their initial one (score they had when they won the previous level).</p>
			<p>The game will spawn enemies a little ahead of the player so that they don't go offscreen that often.</p>
			<p>New enemy: starting in level 3, the game will start spawning a new phantom enemy. This enemy is large and doesn't attack the player, but the player won't be able to go through 
			it or jump and avoid it. The player will be forced to stop and attack this enemy until it's destroyed. The enemy will be spawned randomly on top of a platform</p>
			<p>Added a boss on the second to last platform in each level. The boss is bigger than normal enemies and shoots waves of bullets. The bullets will harm the player but they are 
			slower, so the player can avoid being hit by them. The player needs to destroy the boss in every level.</p>
			<p>Both the new enemy and the boss have a different number of lives and are worth different amounts of points. Moreover, the shooting enemy now shoots these bullets instead of 
			using line renderer since line renderer was being problematic and wasn't working as we expected sometimes.</p>

			<h3>ArtsyShmup version 5 (04/21/2015)</h3>
			<p><b>Improvements over the previous version</b>: The red flashing screen that is displayed when the player is hurt was updated because before it wasn't being noticed by the users. Now 
			the alpha channel has been increased and it's displayed for a longer amount of time.</p>
			<p>Since we introduce a new enemy in levels 1-3, but not in levels 4-6, in the latter we update the enemy parameters. Now, when the user wins and goes to one of those levels 
			the number of normal enemies (green) and shooting enemies (purple) increases by one. The speed of the normal enemies also increases by one, and the spawn delay decreases by 1 in 
			the case of normal enemies, and by 2 in the case of shooting enemies. This will happen in levels 4, 5 and 6.</p>
			<p>Music and sound: The normal levels now have background music that loops infinitely until the player goes to the intermediate level. New sound effects were added and are played when the 
			player jumps or is hurt. The intermediate level, the scene where dialog will take place, now also has background music.</p>

			<h3>ArtsyShmup version 6 (04/28/2015)</h3>
			<p><b>Final fixes</b>: Added cheating system that allows the player to kill all the enemies alive at a given moment. The player 
			is never told about this and can only use it three times in each level. If the player dies and restarts the level, the number of times such system can be used 
			is reset.</p>
			<p>Fixed the intermediate dialogue scene. Now the player sprite is being displayed and Anubis is positioned inside the view.</p>
			<p>We introduced the gameplay before the first level begins. A series of messages will explain the player what to do and the main keys to play the game.</p>
			<p>Added new sprites for the rewards at the end of the level and for the platforms</p>

              <p>Updated the music manager and added unique music to each level.</p>
			  <p>Fixed dialogue typos and bug that wouldn't display the last dialogue scene before showing permanently the 'You won the game' view</p>
